**Capturing Nature Play skills with xAPI**  
The Goal for this Cohort is to look at xAPI as a solution for capturing **Nature Play** skills in Early Childhood Education. We've selected a communication lesson from [Tinkergarten.com](https://tinkergarten.com/our-approach) to prototpe. We will be incorporating the technologies we have used in previous cohorts as listed below. We are going to explore how to best craft statements for rich data that can be used by shareholders developing and promoting Nature Play curriculums.
